If you're here you've been on an important call MacOS has decide it's the perfect time to try sell you another subscription, and sprung open the Apple Music application you never installed and a service you'll never use.

There are fantastic solutions out there like (No Tunes)[https://github.com/tombonez/noTunes] that solve this problem and perform the vital service; preventing corporate humiliation. Though, out of personal vendetta I wanted to learn how to fight the power.

Simply put this just an "AI" automation using something called [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) to vigilantly watch for when Apple Music is opened and let's it know to sit down and be humble.
